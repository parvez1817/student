## Implementation Summary

The workflow has been successfully implemented with the following behavior:

### Login Authentication:
- ✅ First checks `regnumbers` collection - if not found → deny login
- ✅ If found → allow login and proceed to status checks

### Status Checks (in order):
1. **If registerNumber is in idcards**: 
   - LiveTracking = "Under Review" (Step 2)
   - StudentForm = disabled
   - Button text = "Request already submitted"

2. **Else if registerNumber is in printids**:
   - LiveTracking = "Approved & Printing" (Step 3) 
   - StudentForm = disabled
   - Button text = "Request already submitted"

3. **Else if registerNumber is in acceptedidcards**:
   - LiveTracking = "Ready for Pickup" (Step 4)
   - StudentForm = enabled (new request allowed)
   - Button text = "Submit Request"

4. **Else (not found in any collections)**:
   - LiveTracking = "None" (Step 0 - process not started)
   - StudentForm = enabled (new request allowed)
   - Button text = "Submit Request"

The implementation uses the existing `/api/status/:registerNumber` endpoint and properly maps the status values to the frontend components.
